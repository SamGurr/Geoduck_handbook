# <span style="color:turquoise">About</span>

Shellfish aquaculture is essential to prevent overexploitation of wild stock, ensure food security, and meet demands of increasing global trade.

## <span style="color:yellowgreen">Why read this handbook?</span>

This handbook summarizes the results of collaborative research between Jamestown S'klallam Point Whitney Shellfish Hatchery and researchers from University of Washington and University of Rhode Island.

  > *A look inside....*

* General information and standard practices in geoduck production
  - the seed (pun intended) of aquaculture success is the hatchery! Learn about the general techniques and tricks industry deploys to spawn adults, rear larvae, and produce Pacific geoduck seed!


* Tools to improve aquaculture
  - included a step-by-stop guide to strip spawning adult geoduck!
  - Pacific geoduck are sexually dimorphic, however there are no non-intrusive external traits to identify sex - read further to learn about our success in sex identification through non-lethal gonad biopsies.


* Responding to climate change
  - under our current age of the Anthropocene, aquaculture must deploy novel methods as stressors intensify... What if *a moderate dose of stress is actully benefitcial?* and perhaps... *what doesn't kill you makes you stronger!*
  - learn about initial trials testing early-life stress conditioning in a hatchery setting!


included are *photos, tables, and figures* along the way!

## <span style="color:yellowgreen">I.1. The hatchery</span>

#### <span style="color:beige">Hatchery</span>

Sustainable shellfish industry is fueled by success at the hatchery stage. The critical hatchery stages for geoduck production last nearly 7-8 months from November to May/June to condition and spawn adult broodstock and rear larvae to juvenile 'seed'. Early-life stages from embryos to early juveniles are highly susceptible to environmental conditions and disease. Thus, the overarching goal of technicians is to ensure optimal conditions for growth and survival to maximize production of 'seed' of a size ranging ~4 - 7 mm shell length. This 'seed' stage is ideal for growers when geoduck are actively burrowing and able to cope with the planting process during grow-out (*discussed in 'Grow-out' below*).

> *Versatility at the hatchery*: At any snapshot in time, a hatchery is pumping massive amounts of seawater inflow and sustaining billions of live algae cells and shellfish at various life stages. Regardless of the production scale, hatchery maintenance demands versatile training and skills in animal husbandry and microalgae culture -- hatcheries also benefit greatly from some on-the-spot ingenuity! (i.e. carpentry and plumbing).

#### <span style="color:beige">Algae, algae... and more algae</span>

  - <span style="color:gray">**Greenhouse(s) and algae room(s)**</span>: live algae feed is pivotal in hatchery maintanance and production success. Daily, technicians clean, culture, and feed-out both large low-density cultures and small high-density cultures. Typical algae concentrations (cells per milliliter, c-1 ml-1) of the batch cultures range from 50,000 c-1 ml-1 (low density) to 1-2 million c-1 ml-1 (high density). A few important species common to Pacific geoduck aquaculture are *Isocrysis*, *Pavlova*, *Tetraselmis*, and *Chaetoceros*. Feed composition and species density is life-stage dependent for optimal geoduck growth and survivial.

<span style="color:beige">Table: Feed and geoduck life stages</span>

  Life-stage | Age  | Density (c-1 ml-1)  | Composition (algae species)
--------   | -----| ----  | ---
Fetilized eggs / embryo   | 0-0.5 days | NA | NA
Trochophore  |  < 1-2 days | NA | NA
D-hinge & Umbone 'mature' larvae / Prodissoconch I & II  | 2-16 days | 10,000-50,000 (stepwise over time) | small cells; i.e. *Isocrysis*, *Chaetoceros*, *Pavlova*
Pediveliger / Dissoconch   | 16 - 35 days | 50,000 | small cells; i.e. *Isocrysis*, *Chaetoceros*, *Pavlova*
Juvenile  |  36 days - 5 to 7 months (preceeding grow-out) | 50,000 | mixed diet (incliude *Tetraselmis*)
Broodstock (spawning)  |  4-6 years (minimum) | 50,000-200,0000 | mixed; *Isocrysis* preferred to elicit spawning

#### <span style="color:beige">Tank Systems</span>

  - <span style="color:gray">**Stage-depedent systems of tanks**</span>: metamorphic transitions of molluscs from embryo-juvenile stages present a series of challenges. Shellfish aquaculture is mindful of critical developmental transitions that require alterntive systems for survival. For example, 'settlement' is the postlarval stage when geoduck transition from free-swimming larvae to an increasingly sessile (not swimming) stage. The planning and timuing of this stage is essential at the hatchery because 'settled' animals will adhere to the sides of the tank and begin crawling. Therefore, the whole system must transition entirely from upwelling conical tanks (commonly used for free-swmming stags) to downwelling or setting systems with sediment to allow anmals to burrow (downwellers, setting tables, heath stacks).

<span style="color:gray">**Table: Common hatchery systems for each life stage**</span>

  Life-stage | Age  | Tank type  | Common size(s) (L) | Flow-though (Y/N) | Notes
--------   | -----| ----  | --- | --- | ---
Fetilized eggs / embryo   | 0-0.5 days   | larval rearing tank | 5,000 | N | remain static, filters: 20µm banjo filter as fail-safe
Trochophore  |  < 1-2 days | larval rearing tank or conical tank | 250 - 5,000 | N | filters: 20µm banjo filter, light circulation with air/bubbling
D-hinge & Umbone 'mature' larvae / Prodissoconch I & II  | 2-16 days | upwelling conical tank   | 250 - 750 | Y | switch out banjo filters for larger pore size as larvae grow, ths will accomodate higher algae feed and avoid clogging leading to overflow and loss of larvae - some hatcheries integrate a fail safe to be cautious (e.g. mesh tray in the outflow)
Pediveliger / Dissoconch   | 16 - 35 days | setting table, heathstack, downwellers | 15 - 30 L (tray and tank inserts)  | Y  | high seawater flow; sand added; animal density per tank or tray dependent on surface area; start with 180µm lining and increase as animals grow
Juvenile  |  36 days - 5 to 7 months (preceeding grow-out) | 15 - 30 L (tray and tank inserts)  |setting table, heathstack | Y | high seawater flow; sand added; animal density per tank or tray dependent on surface area; large sturdy mesh/lining for 3mm shell sizeminimum
Broodstock (spawning)  |  4-6 years (minimum) | large rectangular tanks | 200+ | Y | high seawater flow, no filters needed

>*PHOTOS*: larval-rearing tanks at Jamestown Point Whitney Shellfish Hatchery in Brinnon, WA (USA). Shown here are large 2k-L tanks used for the initial metamorphosis of fertilized embryos to free-swimming trochophore larvae. This system involved two flat-bottomed conicals that invovle a on-way flow between them so that allow metamorphosed, free-swimming, larvae will eventually stock a single conical whereas delayed/dead embryos remain in the other (left). Center and right are small 250-L conicals used for small batches of larvae - typically hatcheries used larger conicals >=750L conicals for their larvae. At the Jamestown hatchery, these 250-L tanks were used for collaborative experiments.

>*PHOTOS*: Once larvae reach settlement and begin burrowing (indicated by the protruding foot at the pediveliger stage; see I.3 LArvae and Seed, 'Settlement') they are added to  systems such as raceways (left), "three or four-holer downwellers" (center), or heath trays (right). Normally heath trays operate on a flow-over system with seawater ascending top-down in a stack of trays - here (right) heath trays were fitted with a new outflow and inflow to create small-scale downwellers used in collaborative experiments on juvenile geoduck at the hatchery!



## <span style="color:yellowgreen">I.2. Broodstock Conditioning & Natural Spawning</span>

#### <span style="color:beige">Broodstock collection and conditioning:</span>
Broodstock are adult animals either grown or wild caught for spawning in the hatchery. Large-scale hatcheries with the space and resources often collect numerous broodstock from multiple regions to maintain genetic diversity and 'hedge their bets' for spawning.

Pacific geoduck reproduce sexually and are broadcast spawners, meaning males and females release gametes in the water column and rely on the simultaneous release from both sexes for fertilization in open water. In aquaculture, wild or grown broodstock are collected as early as late-Fall and brought to the hatchery. 'Broodstock conditioning' is the process by which hatchery technicians prepare adults for spawning to increase reproductive success and offsrping survival. The timing for 'broodstock conditioning' targets the vital period of 'gametogenesis' or the period during which gametes, especially eggs, are developing and multiplying in adults. A rich diet of algae loaded with essential fats does the trick - it is common to feed broodstock for a few months over gametogenesis before the first attempt at spawning. In addition, a growing field of research suggests that stress from the envrionment can also affect spawning, reproduction, and offsrping survival! (*some resources on this below*)

#### <span style="color:beige">How to Induce Natural Spawning:</span>

- ##### <span style="color:white">dramatic increase in diet:</span>
 Spikes of algal density can provide the spark technicians need to elicit a planned spawning event. A few gallons of dense batch culture are simply added to broodstock tanks.
- ##### <span style="color:white">simulate tidal cycles / handling stress:</span>
 Another method is a short-term exposure out of water. Tanks are rapidly and completely drained. An added benefit of this technique is that broodstock can be removed from the tanks entirely. this permits technicians to wash the tank of faeces and algae biolfilms to ensure optimal conditions for spawning and gamete quality when released. It must be noted that this process is stressful for broodstock and may induce lethal harm if repeated in quick succession or prolonged for extended periods of time.  In combination with diet, high algae culture can be added with the seawater upon re-filling to trigger spawning.
- ##### <span style="color:white">add gametes:</span>
 An artifact of natural spawning is the common scenario of non-simultaneous release of gametes from both males and females. If either sex has released gametes, a sample of this seawater rich in egg or sperm cells can be added to a broodstock tank to trigger additional individuals to spawn. A major caveat here is that you will likley have successful fertilization in the borodstock tank (added sperm activated female to release eggs), thus removing and isolating spawning individuals to a bucket/isolation tank can allow a hatchery to control fertilization and optimize genetic diversity.

## <span style="color:yellowgreen">I.3 Larvae and Seed</span>

### <span style="color:beige">Free-swimming larvae:</span>

*off with a bang!*

Rearing season call for all hands on deck, as embryos and larvae are a tall task. Once fertilized, embryos quickly metamorphose to trochophores and proceeding stages (e.g. prodissoconch I and II) over the course of days to weeks. These larvae are free-swimming requiring specific rearing practices and tricks for successful development.

> *REMEMBER!* conicals and upwellers are used to rear free-swimming larvae. Larval rearing conicals are periodically drained to assess the larvae and get valuable information to answer the following questions...
- Are the larvae developing/metamorphosing to the next stage?
- Have the larvae survived/What are their numbers compared to the previous stage?
- Are we (the hatchery/business) meeting our production timeline?

#### <span style="color:white">Bottleneck for production:</span>

*These little ones are a picky bunch!* Larvae are **highly susceptible** to a wide variety of stressors (e.g. diet, temperature, pH, salinity, pathogens, etc.). Hatcheries face major losses and occasionally ubiquitous mortality of entire cohorts due to even subtle changes!

Below are several common methods to improve production:

- ##### <span style="color:white">Water quality monitoring</span>
hatchery personnel can not change seawater conditions out in the bay or estuary, but they can improve awareness of changes in *real-time!*. Recent research in the Pacific Northwest of the United States found seawater low in aragonite saturation state and pH caused shell malformations and mortality of Pacific oyster larvae. To remedy this issue, an Oregon (USA) hatchery deployed water chemistry sensors to monitory their inflow and the coastal conditions - this allowed hatchery personnel to adjust the timing of their pumps to avoid corrosive seawater with a low pH!

- ##### <span style="color:white">Buffering</span>
in some cases, the hatchery can alter the seawater below exposing animals to potential harm. Sodium bicarbonate is an example of a chemical bioremediation strategy to avoid exposing shellfish to low pH conditions. As a popular method to cope with low pH seawater, hatcheries mix the inflow with sodium bicarbonate to raise the pH and aragonite saturation state to allow the shellfish to build their shells and develop normally. This technique has shown great success, boosting production by 30-50% in areas susceptible to ocean acidification!

- ##### <span style="color:white">Culling</span>
as larvae develop and tanks are periodically drained to count them and maintain their tanks, the slow growers (runts) are set aside or removed. The omission of these animals is called culling. Hatcheries perform culling as a common housekeeping process to reach their production timeline and avoid further - this is especially prevalent in larger industry hatcheries that can cut their losses with the space to accommodate the slower-growing larvae. However, small-business hatcheries may not afford to cull larvae or an only apply more conservative thresholds.

- ##### <span style="color:white">Selective breeding</span>
this strategy targets resilient strains (e.g. disease and environmental stressors) and economic traits (e.g. faster growers) to improve production. Broodstock with are selected due to their better survivorship for developmental rate, for examples, to produce offspring under the assumption that the probability is higher that offspring will express the same attributes.

-  ##### <span style="color:pink">*Warning!*</span>, enhancement does not come without cons...
culling may result in a **genetic bottleneck** (faster growers are from one parental line/population) and adds a **human bias** as slower growers may outpace others at later life stages, also known as a compensatory growth response.

  - *Con* - **domestication selection**
  - *Cons* - the assumption underpinning selective breeding is the heritability of these desirable characteristics - this implies a likely genetic component especially if the trait is present across multiple generations! A main negative outcome of selective breeding is a **genetic bottleneck**. For example, what if a disease resistant strain is *more susceptable* to thermal stress? If hatchery put all their eggs in once basket for disease resiliance, they may fail in proceeding years as seawater temperatures rise.

> *NOTE*: No single method is an 'end all' solution! Outcomes of any adjustment or enhancement strategy are likely to be specific to the region or hatchery! Especially with jobs and profit at risk, it is critical to prototype and run small-scale tests of any changes to standard protocols.

### <span style="color:beige">Settlement:</span>

*'There's digging afoot!'*

No longer free-swimming, a clear indicator that larvae have reached settlement competency is when technicians see small dots lining the inside of the larval rearing conicals. These are the larvae at pediveliger stage when individuals start protruding their foot, this is a muscular structure to allow the animals to begin burrowing!

> *REMEMBER!* A major transition in rearing tanks occurs when larvae are no longer free swimming and settle in the tank(s). Instead of conicals or upwellers, the now pediveliger larvae are grow in down weller systems or raceways.
Review I.1 The hatchery, for pictures and details


Under common ambient temperatures for geoduck production (~14-16 Celcius), larvae reach 'settlement' at around 28-30 days after fertilization. Whereas each proceeding metamorphic stage during larval rearing can yield major losses, the settlement stages have greater survivorship and higher tolerance to stress!

## <span style="color:yellowgreen">I.4 Grow out</span>

<p align="center">
<img src="Geoduck_aquaculture.assets/beach_outplant.JPG" width="400">
</p>

Hatchery producers work alongside growers to sell  seed for 'grow-out'. 'Grow-out' is the process of planting goeduck on the beach. Once burrowed, geoduck are increasingly sessile, meaning that an individual will borrow deeper at it grows but remain in the same burrow for the rest of its life. The process is fairly simple, three seed are planted on each poitn within a covered PVC or mesh lining to prevent predation for the first year. Once one year in age, it is assumed that survivors are burrowed sufficiently deep in the sediment to remove these barriers and remain untouched for several years until market size (4-7 years!). The commercial value of adult geoduck is primarily driven by consumers and international trade. Large-scale industries  often have the infrastructure and land to both rear and grow their own seed emcompassing all aspects of production, however autotomous growers are also common in the Pacific Northwwest and solely purchase seed from local hatcheries to grow on private land.

<span style="color:beige">Table: Timeline of geoduck production</span>

Production stage | Setting  | Timeline
---   | -----| ----
Spawning & Broodstock conditiong  | Hatchery  | 2-4 months
Fertilization-juvenile |  Hatchery  |  0 to 5-7 months

  > *FOOD FOR THOUGHT*: The table and cartoon above demonstrate the timing and significance of the hatchery relative to the grow-out period. As one can see, the hatchery presents a short window (5-7 months) relative to the entire life history of geoduck (up to 168 years) and the market timeline (up tp 7 years!!).

## <span style="color:yellowgreen">II.1 Identification of Sex & Reproductive Status</span>

A major artifact of geoduck aquaculture is the **spontaneous and opportunistic nature of natural spawning events**. For example, an unplanned nighttime natural spawn of a female geoduck set the stage for the growing season at Jamestown Point Whitney Shellfish Hatchery in winter 2019 (*Mat Henderson, personal communication*). Millions of eggs (~30) were released into a single broodstock tank with two dozen other animals (of unknown sex) and under seawater flow-though. In an optimal scenario, technicians would have isolated the spawning female to a static tank to control spawning/fertilization and maximize  egg yield. This event lead to a totally autotomous fertilization process outside of standard 9:00am - 5:00pm work hours. In most cases, spontaneous and unplanned spawning presents major loss in potential profit - luckily, personnel at JPWSH live on site and were able to salvage fertilized embryos.

Losses in production and profit are unfortunately common in shellfish aquaculture. In the story stated above, aquaculture technicians were limited by two main factors:
- **sex identification of broodstock**: The sex is unknown to hatchery personnel and is only revelead once an individual begins spawning.
- **reproductive status of broodstock**: Wild broodstock are typically collected in early winter and are fed algae-rich diets at the hatchery for several weeks/months to assume an optimal reproductive state. However, the timing to start controlled spawning attempts remains poorly understood.

#### <span style="color:beige">We deployed new techniques to track adult geoduck</span>

Trait  | Importance in Aquaculture | Technique | Note
------------- | ------------- | ---------- | ----|
**Sex of broodstock groups** | avoid spontaneous spawning and fertilization; enhance control of spawning attempts | **gonad biopsy** | invasive sub-lethal
|  |   |   |
**Reproductive status** | determine optimal timining for spawning; identify individuals to focus spawning efforts; control and increase diversity| **hemolymph extraction (vitellogenin)**, **gonad biopsy** | minimially invasive; invasive sub-lethal

### <span style="color:beige">II.1.2 General Procedure: Hemolymph Extraction (Vitellogenin)</span>


## <span style="color:yellowgreen">II.2. Strip Spawning</span>

##### <span style="color:beige">About:</span>

Strip spawning is a destructive method for spawning geoduck, meaning all chosen animals are dissected and sacrificed. Therefore, is it ideal to both identify the reproductive status and sex during broodstock conditioning (i.e. gonad biopsy and/or hemolymph extraction) and tag animals . As opposed to natural spawning, strip spawning may save both time and effort by planning fertilization and larval rearing.

##### <span style="color:beige">Steps:</span>

  1. *Weeks before strip spawning* Identify the sex and reproductive status of broodstock. Are animals far along and prepared to spawn? Complete gonad biopsies and use microscopy to observe eggs and sperm. Activate sperm with seawater to assess sperm motility!
  2. Prepare working space for strip spawning. This includes table space, access to 0.2µm filtered seawater, KCl solution, 20µm seives (2-3), seawater table/large tray, access to compound microscope with slides, pipettes, and beakers.
  3. Remove chosen males and females from the broodstock tank (identified weeks beforehand with invasive or non invasive reproductive status assessments)
  4. Dissect broodstock tissu. Cut along the interior shell with a curved spatuala to remove the entire body. Remove the gonad and set aside in a marked position (i.e. a beaker labeled Female # 2)
  5. With a clean scalpel blade, cut shallow striations/hashes along the entire gonad. Work slowly over a rinsed beaker. Gametes will secrete from the tissue. You can also use the blunt side of the scalpel to sweep the striations to increase secretion and hasten this process.
  6. If strip spawning a female goand, use 0.2µm-filtered seawater in a squirt bottle as you strip spawn. Eggs must be in seawater to ensure viability downstream. In contrast, DO NOT use seawater while strip spawning male gonads. This will activate the sperm and leave serm cells unviable when used for fertilization. Strip spawn the male gonad without seawater into a dry beaker and leave fridgerated at 12-14C until all eggs are prepared for fertilization.

  NOTE: all individuals should have a seperate beaker - do not mix gametes

  7. After a female gonad is deplete, add more seawater to the beaker to hydrate eggs. Hydrated eggs appear as nearly perfect circles under microscopy whereas eggs without seawater will appear elongated. Pippette samples and check them after 5-10 minutes.
  8. Once hydrated, eggs are ready for activation. Add KCl to egg batches to target a concentration of 0.1 M KCl, mix gently, and let sit for 15-20 minutes.
  9. Rinse egg batches (seperately per individual!) on a 20 µm seive with filtered seawater. The objective of this step is to remove the KCl and prepare eggs for fertilization. Rinse eggs off the 20 µm seive into a beaker with 0.2 µm filtered seawater.
  10. Activate sperm with seawater and fertilize eggs with small aliquots. Use microscopy to check the eggs after sperm is added (~5-10 minutes). Polyspermy must be avoided and occurs when eggs are overencumbered by sperm leading to low fertilization rate. An optimal range is ~10-30 sperm around each egg.

  NOTE: remember to cross all males with all females to increase diversity!

> - above shows strip-spawned eggs both hydrated and activated with KCl. These 'primed' eggs are nearly perfect circles due to hydration and appear evenly seperated relative to the eggs in prior photos (above).
- eggs are now prepared for fertilization with the activated sperm. Sperm is activated rapidly by adding seawater. It must be noted that sperm viability is best after initial activation. To increase successful fertilization, sperm should be activated immediately prior to being added to batches of eggs.

### <span style="color:yellowgreen">Initial Tests & Results</span>

#### <span style="color:beige">(1) Repeat exposure experiment:</span>

<p align="center">
<img src="Geoduck_aquaculture.assets/experiment_design_1.jpg" height="300">
</p>

Juvenile geoduck *reared under standard hatchery practice* were exposed to a  acute exposures of low pH conditions to measure physiological effects of repeat stress and carryover effects of stress history on subsequent response. After the repeat exposures, animals were reared for 5 months to measure carryover effects.

<span style="color:beige">Life stages:</span>

- juveniles, 5-10 months post-fertilization

Juvenile geoduck *reared under standard hatchery practice* were exposed to a  acute exposures of low pH conditions to measure physiological effects of repeat stress and carryover effects of stress history on subsequent response. After the repeat exposures, animals were reared for 5 months to measure carryover effects.

**Life stage** : postlarval 'settlement' stage (30 das post-fertilization) to juvenile stage (~5-6 months post-fertilization)
