# Pacific Geoduck Aquaculture Handbook
Obj:
Our research aims to understand the effects of environmental stress on sustainable production of
the Pacific geoduck clam.
This document synthesizes our research efforts and
describes how are findings are applied to aquaculture industry.

  > *BACKGROUND*
### About Pacific geoduck *Panogea generosa*
Long-lived infaunal clam (records up to 168 years-of-age) of commercial and ecological importance with a native range from Alaska to Baja, California.

Commercial harvest and aquaculture of geoduck constitutes 27% of the overall shellfish revenue in Washington state and 90% of the global supply

Production of Pacific geoduck in the Pacific Northwest has elevated to satisfy increasing global demand.
### What is the standard practice for geoduck aquaculture?
##### The hatchery:
Reproduction and early development of shellfish are pivotal life stages

The success of a producer is largely dependent on limitations within the hatchery
and experience of its personnel.

##### Broodstock conditioning:

Broodstock are adult animals either grown or collected for spawning in hatcheries.

## Stress conditioning for aquaculture enhancement
#### Review the following terms
##### Ecophysiology:

##### Plasticity:
###### a.) phenotype(s)
Broadly defined as **physical traits** expressed by an organism. These traits are reffered to as **"plastic"** becasue of they can **change in response to the envrionment.** Scientists are now engaged in **phenotypic plasticity** to study the  impact of envrionmental conditions and human disturbances  on the fitness and performance of organisms (i.e. ability to survive, grow, and reproduce)

For example, the development or growth rate of a mollusc are critical phenotypic traits and indicators of animal performance in aquaculture. Hatcheries often focus on "plastic" modifications to growth and development (phenotypes) under an array of diets and temperatures (envrionmental condition).

###### b.) Transgenerational plasticity
Transgenerational plasticity (TGP) is a phenomenon in which parental exposure to an envrionmental condition elicits phenotypic change(s) in their offspring (Kovalchuk 2012; Badyaev 2005). In recent years that has been considerable effort to investigate TGP in response to ocean acidification. **Inheritable stress resiliance** can be an important stradegy for sustainable production.

Long-lived molluscs, such as P. generosa, are incapable of rapid generational turnover on evolutionary timescales to adapt under rapid envrionmental change. TGP, as an acclimatory response, presents a single generation onset of phenotypic modificaitons relative to evolutionary timescales. Investigation of TGP in Pacific geoduck can reveal amaeorative phenotypes to cope with disturabcens such as ocean acidification.
